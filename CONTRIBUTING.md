=======================

# Branches
PASDAC has to important branches, **master** and **development**. The **master** branch is intended to always be in working order. The code in this branch is tested and tried. Code in the development is freshly coded and tested updates, bug fixes, and new contributions that **work**. All other feature branches are for each member to experiment with, work on, fix bugs, and contribute new code to the library.
